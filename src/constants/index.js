    title: "Escape the Cave",
    image: project1,
    description:
      `I created and designed a 3D game in Unity with a partner as a final group project for my game design class. The game was fully coded using C#. The only requirements for the game were we had to use the concepts
      we learned in class but other than that we were able to create whatever we wanted. We decided to we both love playing fantasy free roam games so that is what we wanted to go
      with. We decided on a free roam puzzle based game. The story line was the player was camping with their friends and they got sent to get firewood, however they ended up getting
      lost in the woods and falling into a cave. That is where the official game starts where the player is in the cave and can do some exploring. There are collectibles and also enemies 
      so the player has to progress through multiple rooms which consistent of rooms like a Colosseum, underwater rooms, and other exploring rooms. There are multiple ways to actually
      escape the cave and the player gets to decide which one they want to choose. There is also potential to find a large treasure at the end of the game.`,

    description:
      `Designed a working calendar GUI with a partner for my OOD course as our final project. This calendar was completely done in Java. The code created the GUI and drew the calendar on.
      The events on the calendar were represented by colored blocks which you could click on to see the details of the event. Some of the features included switching the
      users to show the events for that specific user, adding an event, removing an event, and loading a calendar in for a user. There were different screen components where you
      could add and edit the information for an event.`,

    description:
      `For my final project in my computing fundamentals class I created a Math Wordle game completely in Python. The idea of the game was the same as regular Wordle. A math
      equation was randomly generated and the user had a certain number of guesses to determine what the equation was. If there was nothing in the generated equation, the character
      would be red. If the character is in the equation but not in the right spot then it is yellow. If the character is in the right spot and in the equation it turns green. The entire game
      happens in the terminal.`,

      `A partner and I created the bridgit game for fundamentals of computer science 2. The game was fully created in Java. The game consisted of a grid where dark pink represented one player
      and light pink represented the other player. The white squares are the parts that can be filled in. The players turns will swap after they click on a white square. The goal of the game
      is to get a path from one side to the other of your color. The other player can block your path and once a square is a color of pink, it cannot be changed by the other player.`,

      You can use the arrow keys to swap around the empty space and try to get all the tiles numbered left to right 1-15 and the game ends and the user has one.`,
